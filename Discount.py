# The discount calculator calculates the discount based on the total cost of the items purchased. The discount is calculated based on the following criteria:
#
# If the total cost is less than Rs. 2000, a discount of 5% is applied.
# If the total cost is between Rs. 2000 and Rs. 5000, a discount of 25% is applied.
# If the total cost is between Rs. 5001 and Rs. 10000, a discount of 35% is applied.
# If the total cost is greater than Rs. 10000, a discount of 50% is applied.
